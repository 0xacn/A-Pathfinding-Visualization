# A* Pathfinding Visualization

This is my first attempt at A* pathfinding. I made this visualization to show the beauty of pathfinding. You can modify all major features of my algorithm through the graphics interface. Here I will go through the major features of my program.

## Basic Controls
You must create a map to start the pathfinding. The start node is blue, end node is red and the walls are black. 

To create nodes:
  - Start: hold 's' + left click
  - End: hold 'e' + left click
  - Wall: left click
  
To delete nodes:
  - same as creation, except right click!
